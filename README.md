<b>Mock-up challenge for Bootstrap course</b>
<br><br>

<strong><u>Instructions</u>:</strong>
<br><br>

Take some time to download the mock and paint grid lines to cut up the containers, rows, and columns. Use Emmett abbreviations in your mock as a general guideline for your HTML elements. Taking the time to draw out on top of the mock will speed up the coding process.

Be sure to do this prior to starting with any coding. In the next lesson we will use the provided solution to actually build out the site in HTML and CSS

How many rows do you think there are in this mock?
How many containers do you think this site uses?
How can you use the bootstrap grid system to keep slight margins to the left and right in a .container-fluid and still use two .col-6?
